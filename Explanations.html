        <li><h2>No Illicit Sex</h2></li>
        <p>What is illicit? If a person marries according to the procedure outlined in scriptures and engages in sex with his wife for begetting nice children, it is legal and religious. Any other means adopted to satisfy ones demands for sexual gratification is considered illicit.</p>

        <li><h2>No Intoxication</h2></li>
        <p>Intoxication refers to the taking into the body of various chemicals that are not necessary for bodily maintenance and have stimulating or depressive effects on the mind and body. Under this heading the Vedic scriptures include everything from tea, coffee and tobacco, with their caffeine and nicotine, to liquor and other more powerful drugs.<br/>Countless people in this age depend on some such intoxicants for stimulation or relief from anxiety, but any objective observer will conclude that such enjoyment or relief is only transitory and therefore has no real substance.</p>
